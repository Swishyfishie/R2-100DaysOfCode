## Day 1

### GitHub Profile finder with Traversy Media's JS tutorial

In this project I used Github API calls, Classes, Promises, Async/Await and generally ES6 code. This is an app that allows you to search for users on github and it will display some info of theirs.

### Openweather_API project + Pig_lating challenge

On day 2 I did an weather app with the help of Traversy Media's JS tutorial and replicated an app from a friend's repository. The pig lating app that he did was taking the first letter of a word and adding it to the end + the "ay" letters. He did it in python and I did it in JavaScript. Considering to quit studying javascript at this point.
