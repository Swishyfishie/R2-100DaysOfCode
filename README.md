# R2-100DaysOfCode

## Day 1

---

### GitHub Profile finder with Traversy Media's JS tutorial

In this project I used Github API calls, Classes, Promises, Async/Await and generally ES6 code. This is an app that allows you to search for users on github and it will display some info of theirs.

## Day 2

### Openweather_API project + Pig_lating challenge

On day 2 I did an weather app with the help of Traversy Media's JS tutorial and replicated an app from a friend's repository. The pig lating app that he did was taking the first letter of a word and adding it to the end + the "ay" letters. He did it in python and I did it in JavaScript. Considering to quit studying javascript at this point.

## Day 3 and 4

## Error Handling and Regular expressions

I wasn't able to post on Day 3 so I decided to post both 3 and 4 at the same time.
Error handling. This might be useful when I'll go into debugging. I'm sure it's more useful than what I can see at the moment

As for regular expressions ? I think I need to get used to them but I am ok with not reinventing the wheel as you can find many regex testers online for phone numbers, emails and all sort of things.

## Day 5

## Iterators, Generators and a Dating profile scroller

Today I had a short session of coding due to the fact that I want to play world of warcraft classic. Yep, that's my reason of not working for Tesla already. However, I had fun learning about iterators, generators and made a dating profile scroller.
